I am currently in my final semester of undergraduate studies at Columbia University. Previously I attended Sarah Lawrence College where I had the oppurtunity to play division III soccer and began liberal arts studies. It was at Sarah Lawrence where I was introduced to computer science and I never looked back. Being a huge sports fan I have a lot fun mixing computer science with the world of sports. I would love to collaborate with anybody who likes to do the same!
